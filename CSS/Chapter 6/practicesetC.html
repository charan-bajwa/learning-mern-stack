                <h1>The Song of Wandering Aengus</h1>
                <p>
                    I went out to the hazel wood,
                    Because a fire was in my head,
                    And cut and peeled a hazel wand,
                    And hooked a berry to a thread;
                    And when white moths were on the wing,
                    And moth-like stars were flickering out,
                    I dropped the berry in a stream
                    And caught a little silver trout.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I had laid it on the floor
                    I went to blow the fire a-flame,
                    But something rustled on the floor,
                    And someone called me by my name:
                    It had become a glimmering girl
                    With apple blossom in her hair
                    Who called me by my name and ran
                    And faded through the brightening air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though I am old with wandering
                    Through hollow lands and hilly lands,
                    I will find out where she has gone,
                    And kiss her lips and take her hands;
                    And walk among long dappled grass,
                    And pluck till time and times are done,
                    The silver apples of the moon,
                    The golden apples of the sun.
                </p>
